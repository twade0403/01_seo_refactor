## First Homework 9/17/2020

The sample code provided had several issues that I could see

* In the navigation bar "Search Engine Optimization" held a broke link
* Missing Title
* Excess CSS Code
* Non-semantic HTML Tags

## Changes I made

* To fix the "Search Engine Optimization" link in the navigation bar I added the id
* I added the title "Horiseon"
* I condensed some of the CSS code to try and eliminate the excess code
* I added semantic HTML tags where I saw fit
